We want to use plans to charge for Skill Packages because each package comes with support and we want to encourage
customers to renew the Skill Package every year.


## Billing Model
We support a metered billing model plus a regular flat fee plan model for the Skills packages. A new customer chooses
first a platform plan then, optionally, she can purchase a subscription to a Skill Package plan.


## Data Model
The models are stored in Chargebee Service. Mapping between an Organization record and a Chargebee Customer is achieved
via the field chargebee_customer_id in the organizations entity.
One Ellipsis Organization entity can have multiple Subscriptions but only one of them will be to a metered plan.

## Metered Billing
Every 10 minutes we run an actor that fetches the list of pending invoices and process them.
